This is a simple Snake game implemented in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It features a colorful and animated background and keeps track of your score as you control the snake to eat apples.

## How to Play

- Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to control the direction of the snake (up, down, left, right).
- Your goal is to guide the snake to eat the red apples.
- Each apple eaten increases your score by 100 points.
- The game ends if the snake collides with the screen borders or itself.
- You can restart the game by pressing any arrow key after it ends.
